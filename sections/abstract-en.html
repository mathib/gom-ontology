<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Geometry Metadata Ontology contains terminology to Coordinate Systems (CS), length units and other metadata (file size, software of origin, etc.). GOM is designed to be at least compatible with OMG (Ontology for Managing Geometry) and gom (File Ontology for Geometry formats), and their related graph patterns.

In addition, GOM provides terminology for some experimental data structures to manage (marked as vs:term_status = unstable):
* transformed geometry (e.g. a prototype door geometry that is reused for all doors of this type). This is closely related to the transformation of Coordinate Systems</span>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	The namespace for GOM terms is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">https://www.w3id.org/gom#</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	The suggested prefix for the GOM namespace is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">gom</span>

	The Turtle version of the GOM ontology is available at <a href="https://www.w3id.org/gom/gom.ttl">https://www.w3id.org/gom/gom.ttl</a><br>
	The RDF/XML version of the GOM ontology is available at <a href="https://www.w3id.org/gom/gom.rdf">https://www.w3id.org/gom/gom.rdf</a><br>
	The JSON-LD version of the GOM ontology is available at <a href="https://www.w3id.org/gom/gom.jsonld">https://www.w3id.org/gom/gom.jsonld</a><br>

<span class="markdown">Additional geometry modelling/processing applications can be added as **instances** of the `gom:GeometryModellingApplication` class. If you notice that some geometry application is missing and you need it for your project, you can either create an issue in the [Github repository](https://github.com/mathib/gom-ontology), or you can fork it and submit a pull request.</span>
<span class="markdown">An [online sparql-visualizer demo](https://madsholten.github.io/sparql-visualizer/?file=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathib/gom-ontology/master/examples/gom-demo.json) is available, containing sample Abox triples and example queries. The RDF literals in the Abox triples are dummies to make it more easily to visualize them as a graph.</span>
